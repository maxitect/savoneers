            Our Story
          </h2>
          <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700">
            Today, many commercial soaps are filled with synthetic chemicals and
            artificial additives. Ingredients like triclosan and parabens have
            been linked to skin irritation and hormonal disruptions.
            Additionally, the widespread use of palm oil in soap production has
            led to significant deforestation, threatening wildlife habitats and
            contributing to climate change.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700">
            Disheartened by these realities, Maxime founded Savoneers with a
            simple belief: skincare should nurture the skin and be kind to the
            planet. Partnering with local artisans across England, we set out to
            create natural, sustainable soaps free from harmful additives and
            environmentally damaging ingredients.
