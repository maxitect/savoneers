                  Our Story
                </h2>
                <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700">
                  Today, many commercial soaps are filled with synthetic
                  chemicals and artificial additives. Ingredients like triclosan
                  and parabens have been linked to skin irritation and hormonal
                  disruptions. Additionally, the widespread use of palm oil in
                  soap production has led to significant deforestation,
                  threatening wildlife habitats and contributing to climate
                  change.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700">
                  Disheartened by these realities, Maxime founded Savoneers with
                  a simple belief: skincare should nurture the skin and be kind
                  to the planet. Partnering with local artisans across England,
                  we set out to create natural, sustainable soaps free from
                  harmful additives and environmentally damaging ingredients.
